                <p>The Old Nupe Market or the Old Dutch Market is a historic, European-built structure in 
                    Matara. The building was built in the late eighteenth century, probably by the British,
                    but possibly by the Dutch. It was used to house the Nupe market.
                    <br><br>
                    The building is located at the Nupe junction on Nilwala Bypass road about 2 km distance 
                    from the Matara Bus station. The british constructed this building during their 
                    colonial period to be used as a marketplace.
                    <br><br>
                    The building is built in a distinctive ‘T’ shape which is perfectly symmetrical. 
                    Presently, the Old Dutch Trade Centre still showcases how it would have been during its 
                    heyday, as it still reverberates with commercial activity.

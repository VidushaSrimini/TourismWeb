                <p>Dondra is a settlement on the extreme southernmost tip of Sri Lanka, in the Indian Ocean 
                    near Matara, Southern Province, Sri Lanka. The Dondra Head Lighthouse, ruins of several 
                    Hindu shrines of Tenavaram are located in the vicinity.
                    <br><br>
                    Historically known as Devinuwara temple port town or Devinuwara temple town, Dondra was 
                    until the late 16th century a historic temple port town complex. A multi-religious site,
                    its primary deity was the Buddhist god Upulvan and at its zenith was one of the most 
                    celebrated religious sites of the island, containing a thousand statues of the various 
                    sects of Hinduism and Buddhism.
                    <br><br>
                    The rebuilt temple to Vishnu and the Vihara still attracts pilgrims today and in the 
                    month of Esala (Julyâ€“August) the Dondra Fair and Perahara is held for eight days.
                    Dondra was once the capital of the Sri Lanka.

                <p>Coconut tree hill is a popular tourist destination in the country and is located at a 
                    headland with a coconut plantation. Coconut Tree Hill, despite being located on 
                    privately owned lands, is one of the most Instagrammed locations in Sri Lanka.
                    <br><br>
                    The best times to visit for these calmer oceans and stable weather is between January 
                    to April and Mid July to September, and this applies for the whole country.
                    However, February to September is calm and dry too, but only in the North and East.

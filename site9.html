                <p>Located just a few minutes away from the Star Fort, the Matara Fort was built by the 
                    Dutch Empire much earlier than its Star Fort counterpart to protect the land from any 
                    outside invader coming from the sea.
                    <br><br>
                    The Matara Fort was built in the year 1645, however, proved to be ineffective against 
                    the Kandyan forces who attacked from the inland as it was captured in 1761, only to be 
                    recaptured by the Dutch a year after.
                    <br><br>
                    Presently though, the old Matara Fort area has been restored and has a stark 
                    resemblance to that of its Galle counterpart, which further asserts its historical 
                    prominence in the island. One of the highlights is the ramparts, as it gives a 
                    panoramic view of the Indian Ocean.
